There are few that love Math and our goal is to even the odds:-)

# Motivation

Mathematics is an incredibly important and fascinating subject that plays a vital role in our everyday lives. From simple addition and subtraction to complex algorithms and theories, math is everywhere around us, whether we realize it or not. One of the most significant applications of math in our daily lives is in the financial sector, where it helps us make informed decisions regarding loans and investments. For instance, when you apply for a loan, math can help you determine whether the loan you get is a good one or not. By using mathematical formulas and tools, lenders can calculate the interest rates and other charges on loans, which help borrowers decide whether the loan is feasible for them or not. Similarly, when you are investing your money, math can help you determine the potential returns and risks associated with the investment.

Moreover, math plays a crucial role in the optimization of costs for personal businesses. In today's world, businesses need to be cost-efficient to stay competitive, and math can help them achieve that. By using mathematical models, businesses can analyze their operations, identify areas where they can cut costs, and optimize their resources. For instance, a business owner can use mathematical models to analyze their production processes and determine the optimal amount of resources required to produce the desired output. This can help them minimize waste, reduce production costs, and maximize their profits.

Another fascinating application of math is the "Traveling Salesman" problem. This problem involves finding the shortest possible route that a salesman can take to visit a set of cities and return to his starting point. While this may seem like a simple problem, it has numerous real-world applications, such as in logistics and transportation. For instance, logistics companies use mathematical models to determine the most efficient routes for their delivery trucks, reducing fuel consumption, and minimizing delivery times. Similarly, airlines use mathematical algorithms to optimize their flight schedules and reduce travel times, allowing them to offer more flights and reduce costs.

In conclusion, math is an incredibly powerful tool that has numerous applications in our everyday lives, from making informed financial decisions to optimizing business processes and reducing travel times. Whether we realize it or not, math is all around us, and understanding its principles and applications can help us make better decisions and live more efficient lives.

### JPEG

JPEG compression is a method of reducing the file size of digital images while maintaining an acceptable level of image quality. JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, which is the name of the committee that developed this compression technique.

The process of JPEG compression involves several steps. First, the image is divided into small blocks of pixels, usually 8x8 pixels in size. Then, a mathematical formula called the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is applied to each block of pixels. This formula analyzes the brightness and color information in each block and converts it into a series of coefficients that represent the most important features of that block.

The next step is to quantize the coefficients, which means rounding them off to a smaller range of values. This reduces the amount of data required to represent the image, resulting in a smaller file size. However, this also leads to some loss of image quality, as some of the less important details in the image are discarded.

Finally, the quantized coefficients are encoded using a lossless or lossy compression algorithm. In lossless compression, the original data can be completely reconstructed from the compressed data, while in lossy compression, some information is permanently lost in order to achieve a higher compression ratio.

Overall, JPEG compression is a widely used method for reducing the file size of digital images while maintaining an acceptable level of quality. It is commonly used for storing and sharing photographs on the internet and in digital media.
